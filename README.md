# ✨ My Journey in Code So Far

## 🧪 About This Project

This repository isn’t just about code — it’s about progress. It’s a sandbox for learning, trying, breaking, fixing, and growing.

## 📖 A Story Behind the Code

In a small corner of a shared dorm room, during late nights fueled by tea and curiosity, I started this journey — not with confidence, but with a simple desire to understand the _why_ behind the screen.

I wasn’t from a coding family. I wasn’t a genius. I just showed up — every day — learning one line at a time.

This project is more than charts and functions.  
It’s a quiet testimony to growth.  
From tutorials to trials, bugs to breakthroughs, I’ve built this piece by piece — sometimes frustrated, often learning, and always moving forward.

And this is just the beginning. 🌱
